During the latter part of your European vacation, you are hanging out at the beach at the gold coast of Spain. As you are laying in your chaise lounge soaking up the warm Mediterranean sun, a large glob of seagull poop hits you in the face. Since you got an  “A” in ICPE you are able to estimate the impact velocity at 98.5 m/s. Neglecting air resistance, calculate how high up the seagull was flying when it pooped.
