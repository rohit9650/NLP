A golf ball is projected with a horizontal velocity of 30 m/s and takes 4.0 seconds to reach the ground. (Assume g= 10 m/s² and the air resistance is negligible.) Calculate: the height from which the golf ball was projected. The magnitude of the golf balls’ vertical velocity component just before hitting the ground. The horizontal velocity component. Resultant velocity just before the object strikes the ground. The horizontal component of the object’s displacement.
