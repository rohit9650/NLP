"A 21.3-kg child positions himself on an inner-tube which is suspended by a 7.28-m long rope attached to a strong tree limb. The child and tube is drawn back until it makes a 17.4-degree angle with the vertical. The child is released and allowed to swing to and from. Assuming negligible friction, determine the child's speed at his lowest point in the trajectory.",9
A 62.9-kg downhill skier is moving with a speed of 12.9 m/s as he starts his descent from a level plateau at 123-m height to the ground below. The slope has an angle of 14.1 degrees and a coefficient of friction of 0.121. The skier coasts the entire descent without using his poles; upon reaching the bottom he continues to coast to a stop; the coefficient of friction along the level surface is 0.623. How far will he coast along the level area at the bottom of the slope?,9
A ball is dropped from a height of 10 m. What is its velocity when it hits the ground?,9
"A sled of mass m is given a kick on a frozen pond, imparting to it an initial speed vi = 2.0 m/s. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the ice and the sled is mk=0.10. Use energy considerations to find the distance the sled moves before stopping.",9
"Box having mass 3kg thrown with an initial velocity 10 m/s on an inclined plane of angle 30 degrees. If the box passes from the point B with 4m/s velocity, find the work done by friction force.",9
A ball with enough speed can complete a vertical loop. With what speed must the ball enter the loop to complete a 2 m loop? (Keep in mind that the velocity of the ball is not constant throughout the loop).,9
An elevator must lift 1000 kg a distance of 100 m at a velocity of 4 m/s. What is the average power the elevator exerts during this trip?,9
A car of mass 1000 kg travelling at 30m/s has its speed reduced to 10m/s by a constant breaking force over a distance of 75m.The cars initial kinetic energy,9
A baseball player catches a 163-gram baseball which is moving horizontally at a speed of 39.8 m/s. Determine the force which she must apply to the baseball if her mitt recoils a horizontal distance of 25.1 cm.,9
A cat stuck up a tree and has 500 J gravitational potential energy. It then falls. Find the kinetic energy of the cat just before it is caught by the owner. Find the kinetic energy of the cat after it is caught by the owner. Find the wasted energy (after cat is caught by the owner).,9
