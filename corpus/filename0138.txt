Â A vehicle traveling 60 km/h approaches an intersection just as the traffic light turns yellow. The yellow light lasts only 2.0 s before turning to red. The distance to the near side of the intersection is 30 m and the intersection is 15 m wide. The vehicle can decelerate at -6.4 m/s 2 , whereas it can accelerate from 60 km/h to 70 km/h in 3.0 s.  a. If the brakes are applied, how far will the vehicle travel before stopping? If the vehicle accelerates, how far will it travel before the light turns red?
