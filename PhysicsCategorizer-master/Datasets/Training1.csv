A student applies a force to a cart to pull it up an inclined plane at constant speed during a physics lab. A force of 20.8 N is applied parallel to the incline to lift a 3.00-kg loaded cart to a height of 0.450 m along an incline which is 0.636-m long. Determine the work done upon the cart and the subsequent potential energy change of the cart.,9

"Claire deAisles has just completed her shopping at the grocery food store. She accidentally bumps her 42.5-kg cart, setting it in motion from rest down a hill inclined at 14.9 degrees. Upon descending a distance of 9.27 meters along the inclined plane, the cart hits a tree stump (which was placed in the parking lot for the sole purpose of this problem). A 0.295-kg can of tomato soup is immediately hurled from the moving cart and heads towards Will N. Tasue's brand new Lexus. Upon striking the Lexus, the tomato soup can creates a dent with a depth of 3.16 cm. Noah Formula, who is watching the entire incident and fixing to do some physics, attempts to calculate the average force which the Lexus applies to the soup can. Assume negligible air resistance and friction forces and help Noah out.",9

"Pete Zaria applies a 11.9-Newton force to a 1.49-kg mug of root beer in order to accelerate it from rest over a distance of 1.42-m. Once released, how far will the mug slide along the counter top if the coefficient of friction is 0.728?",9
Suzie Lovtaski has a mass of 49.7 kg. She is at rest on top of a hill with a height of 92.6 m and an incline angle of 19.2 degrees. She coasts down the hill to the bottom and eventually comes to a stop; she never uses her poles to apply a force.

A ball of mass 2.00-kg is dropped from a height of 1.5 m (from the ground) onto a massless spring (the spring has an equilibrium length of 0.50 m). The ball compresses the spring by an amount of 0.20 m by the time it comes to a stop. Calculate the spring constant of the spring.,9

"An object in free fall is said to have reached terminal velocity if the air resistance becomes strong enough to counteract all gravitational acceleration, causing the object to fall at a constant speed. The exact value of the terminal velocity varies according to the shape of the object, but can be estimated for many objects at 100 m/s. When a 10 kg object has reached terminal velocity, how much power does the air resistance exert on the object?",9
